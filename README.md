# Vulcan-Salute
A motorized hand doing a Vulcan Salute with LEDs in the fingers, controlled by Blynk and an ESP8266 . My entry into the 2017 Hackaday.io Sci-Fi contest

Fire up your Blynk app, hit the GO button! With this moving Vulcan Salute, you will instantly notice that you are living a longer and more prosperous life.
To make the fingers light up, I started using 8mm PL9823 LEDs, but I wanted the project to be bigger and even more blinky. 
I scaled up the model and added holes for 60 per meter strips of LEDs. The outline of the hand will feature inward facing single-color LEDs 
that will show a breathing animation. The half-mirrored surface will enable a bit of infinity effect. Buttons on the Blynk app will let 
the viewer change LED patterns, change breathe rate of the single-color LEDs, and change the motor speed (salute speed).
